Simple Trivia Game

User Selects one answer from multiple radio buttons.

Timer starts at 2:00 minutes and counts down by 1 second.

Upon hitting the "Submit" button, game will total your correct answers and display them below the button.

PSEUDO CODE- The timer function does not cooperate with the rest of the page. Attempted to stop the function with a 'return;' when (min === 0 && sec === 0), may be an issue with the way I built timer. Am also trying to trigger the function showResults(); when the timer reaches zero to automatically total the score.
